    "If you have not installed Python via anaconda, it is strongly recommended to install Python 3.6 via Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download/.  Anaconda is a free and open source distribution of the Python programming language for data science and machine learning related applications. It is great tool to simplify package installation and management. We will discuss about packages in detail as we move forward. Another advantage of installing Python via Anaconda is that it installs a multi-utility Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called Jupyter Notebook that provides comprehensive facilities to to programmers for writing and running codes. \n",

    "\n",
    "### **1.2 Launching Kernel (both MacOS and Windows)**\n",
    "To launch a Python Kernel, click ***New*** on the right side and select ***python3*** from the dropdown list (See below). This will launch the kernel where you can write and run your code. Note that Python kernel is a program that runs and introspects the user's code. \n",

    "\n",
    "Now, we are all set to write and run the code! However, before start writing any meaningful codes, it is important to understand the pivotal role of ***Packages*** and ***modules*** in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "### ***1.3 Packages*** and ***modules*** \n",
    "\n",
    "***Module***: In Python, ***module*** is a piece of software that has a specific functionality. For example, while  analyzing financial time series of a certain company (say stock price in last one year), you are required to compute average stock price in a given week. To do the **averaging** operation, you will require a ***module*** that has set of commands to calculate average of numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Package***: On the other hand, a ***package*** is collection of ***Python modules***. A ***package*** directory (or folder) always contains a file  with extension ***\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py***. If this file is present, Python recognises this folder as a special folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us go back to our Financial time-series example. In addition to performing averages, you want to calculate variance (or standard deviation),  trends, seasonality, etc. Hence, you will create a **package** that will contain various ***modules*** to compute average, trends, seasonality, etc. Figure below shows how sample ***package*** looks like. ***.py*** files are individual ***modules*** within the package. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"package.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"1000\" height = \"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we need not write packages for most of the tasks that we want to do via Python. Since Python is an open-source language (See chapter 1), developers across the globe contribute packages to do various tasks ranging from averaging to spatial analysis. We can install these packages via Anaconda and ***import*** these into Python environment. A few packages that we will use often includes ***pandas*** for data analysis , ***numpy***: to handle arrays, and ***os***: to interact with operating system via Python. \n",

For example to install ***pandas***, type ***conda install pandas***  and press enter. \n",
