    "***\"To be or not to be, that is the question...\"***: In any programming language, a control structure is a block of instructions that analyzes variables and chooses a direction in which to go based on given conditions. Control structures are decision making process in programming that determines how computer will respond when given certain conditions. Control structures control \"flow\" of computing and decision making. These control structures include if-else statements, for loops, while loop, and nested versions of these. We will understand each of these with help of various examples. \n",

Now that we have enough toy examples (thanks to anonymous dealer and anonymous grader!), it is right time to use this knowledge to perform analysis on real data. In next chapter, we will discuss basics of Dataframe, Pandas, and plotting figures in Python.  "
